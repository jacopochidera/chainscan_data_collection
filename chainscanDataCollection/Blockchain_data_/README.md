# FastAPI Alchemy Blockchain Data Backend

This Python backend application, built with FastAPI, provides an asynchronous API for collecting and serving blockchain data obtained using the Alchemy API. It offers efficient endpoints to retrieve on-chain information, monitor events, and analyze blockchain activity, making the data readily accessible to other applications.

## Features

* **Asynchronous API with FastAPI:** Leverages FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities for high performance and efficient handling of concurrent requests.
* **Multi-Chain Support:** Supports data collection from various blockchain networks accessible through Alchemy (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism). Network configuration is easily managed.
* **Well-Defined API Endpoints:** Clear and concise API endpoints for various blockchain data retrieval tasks (e.g., fetching block details, transaction information, address balances).
* **Event Streaming (Optional):** (Specify if implemented) Supports real-time streaming of blockchain events using technologies like WebSockets integrated with FastAPI.
* **Data Caching (Optional):** (Specify if implemented) Implements asynchronous caching mechanisms (e.g., using `asyncio.Lock` or libraries like `FastAPI Caching`) to enhance performance and reduce redundant Alchemy API calls.
* **Seamless Alchemy API Integration:** Utilizes the Alchemy SDK for Python for efficient and reliable interaction with the Alchemy API.
* **Flexible Configuration:** Uses environment variables and/or configuration files for managing API keys, network settings, and application parameters.
* **Scalable Design:** Built with asynchronous operations to handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently.
* **Dependency Injection:** FastAPI's built-in dependency injection system promotes clean and maintainable code.
* **Automatic Data Validation and Serialization:** FastAPI's Pydantic integration ensures automatic request and response data validation and serialization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+**
* **pip** (Python package installer)
* An **Alchemy API Key**. Sign up for a free account at [https://www.alchemy.com/](https://www.alchemy.com/).
* (Optional) **Docker** for containerization.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd fastapi-alchemy-backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the `.env.example` file.
    * Add your Alchemy API key and other necessary configurations:
        ```
        ALCHEMY_API_KEY="YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY"
        UVICORN_APP="main:app"  # Replace 'main' with your main file name if different
        UVICORN_HOST="0.0.0.0"
        UVICORN_PORT="8000"
        UVICORN_RELOAD="True" # For development
        # Add other configuration variables as needed (e.g., database URI)
        ```
        Replace `"YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY"` with your actual Alchemy API key.

### Running the Backend

#### Using Uvicorn

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
